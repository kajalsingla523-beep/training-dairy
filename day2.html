        <h1>Training Day 2 Report</h1>
        <p><strong>Date:</strong> 21 June 2024</p>
        <p><strong>Training Topic:</strong> Basic Syntax and Data Types</p>
        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Today, I learned the basic syntax rules of Java, including naming conventions, code structure, and how Java handles data types such as int, float, char, boolean, etc.</p>

        <p><strong>In-Depth Topic Overview:</strong> Java has a strong type system and follows strict syntax rules. I learned about primitive data types and how to declare and initialize variables. Topics like type casting, constants (`final`), and escape sequences were also covered.</p>

        <p><strong>Practical Exercises:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Declaring and initializing all data types</li>
            <li>Using print statements to output data</li>
            <li>Applying implicit and explicit type conversions</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p><strong>Challenges Faced:</strong> Got confused between float and double precision differences. Resolved it by using suffix 'f' for floats and checking documentation.</p>

        <p><strong>Self-Review:</strong> Practiced exercises on data types, wrote small programs, and ensured I could explain the difference between primitive types clearly.</p>

        <p><strong>Tools Used:</strong> IntelliJ IDEA, Java JDK, Online Compiler</p>
        <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Learning Java's syntax and data types is fundamental. I'm now comfortable writing basic Java programs using variables and expressions.</p>
