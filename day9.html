    <h1>Day 9 - Java Industrial Training Diary</h1>
    <h2>Date: 3 July 2024</h2>

    <h2>Topic Covered:</h2>
    <p>Polymorphism in Java</p>

    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Studied polymorphism, one of the core concepts of Object-Oriented Programming. Understood the difference between compile-time (method overloading) and runtime polymorphism (method overriding). Explored how dynamic method dispatch works in Java.</p>

    <h2>Practical Implementation:</h2>
    <p>Practiced method overriding and dynamic dispatch. Created classes with overridden methods and invoked them through parent class references to observe polymorphic behavior.</p>

    <h2>Challenges Faced:</h2>
    <p>Understanding runtime polymorphism was difficult. Initially got confused between overloading and overriding, but examples helped clarify.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
    <p>Polymorphism improves code flexibility and reusability. I now feel confident in implementing method overloading and overriding in Java.</p>
