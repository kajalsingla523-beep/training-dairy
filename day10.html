    <h1>Day 10 - Java Industrial Training Diary</h1>
    <h2>Date: 4 July 2024</h2>

    <h2>Topic Covered:</h2>
    <p>Abstraction and Interfaces in Java</p>

    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Learned how abstraction works using abstract classes and interfaces. Understood how interfaces allow multiple inheritance in Java and provide contract-based implementation. Compared abstract classes and interfaces with examples.</p>

    <h2>Practical Implementation:</h2>
    <p>Created abstract classes and interfaces. Implemented them in child classes. Used interfaces to simulate multiple inheritance scenarios.</p>

    <h2>Challenges Faced:</h2>
    <p>Used abstract class where interface was required. Clarified the difference and purpose through coding exercises.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
    <p>Abstraction helps hide complex implementation and provides clean design. Interfaces are powerful tools for flexibility in architecture.</p>
