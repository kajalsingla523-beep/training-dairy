    <h1>Day 11 - Java Industrial Training Diary</h1>
    <h2>Date: 5 July 2024</h2>

    <h2>Topic Covered:</h2>
    <p>Java Packages and Access Modifiers</p>

    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Studied Java packages (built-in and user-defined) and how to organize code using them. Understood the four access modifiers in Java and their use in restricting access at class, package, and subclass levels.</p>

    <h2>Practical Implementation:</h2>
    <p>Created and used user-defined packages. Explored public, private, protected, and default access modifiers through class structures.</p>

    <h2>Challenges Faced:</h2>
    <p>Package import errors due to folder structure. Learned to structure directories properly and compile using `-d` flag.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
    <p>Packages help in organizing code efficiently. Access modifiers are crucial for encapsulation and data hiding in Java.</p>
