    <h1>Day 12 - Java Industrial Training Diary</h1>
    <h2>Date: 8 July 2024</h2>

    <h2>Topic Covered:</h2>
    <p>Exception Handling in Java</p>

    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Learned about Java's exception handling model including try-catch blocks, finally clause, and custom exceptions. Understood how exceptions are thrown and caught to avoid program crashes.</p>

    <h2>Practical Implementation:</h2>
    <p>Created Java programs using try-catch blocks. Wrote custom exceptions and handled input mismatch and file not found errors.</p>

    <h2>Challenges Faced:</h2>
    <p>Nested try blocks were initially confusing. Practiced multiple examples to grasp flow of control.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
    <p>Exception handling is essential for robust programming. I now understand how to manage runtime errors effectively.</p>
