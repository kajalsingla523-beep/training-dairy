<h1>Day 25 - 26 July 2024</h1>
<h2>Java Development Industrial Training</h2>

    <p>Today, we built on yesterdayâ€™s Swing knowledge and integrated JDBC to create a functional <strong>Student Management System</strong> GUI. The application allows adding, viewing, updating, and deleting student records through a simple interface.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <p class="time">10:00 AM - 12:00 PM</p>
    <p>I implemented database connectivity inside event listeners so that actions like clicking the "Save" button insert a record into the database instantly. 
    This helped me understand event-driven programming in Java much better.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>This was the first time I combined front-end Java (Swing) with backend JDBC in one project. The result was satisfying and felt like a real-world application.</p>
